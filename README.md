# langchain-study
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts I wrote to experiment with LangChain's modules using Python. According to LangChain's documentation, it is a machine learning framework for developing applications powered by large language models. 

## Contents
- The notebook `langchain101.ipynb` contains simple exercises to test and understand the basic features of the framework.
- `crypto.py` essentially tests the integration of a LLM with Google's SERP API and a simple memory buffer.
- `docs.py` a very simple script to upload PDFs and ask questions about it, using embeds and similitary search.
- `data_analysis(pandas_pyplot).ipynb` is about querying a data source in natural language using the pandas library.
- `sql.ipynb` is a very incomplete test with integrating LLMs with relational databases using SQLAlchemy.

## Technologies
- Python.
- LangChain.
